# Othello
AKA Reversi

Fun attempt to code a strategy board game in my down time.

Functionality:  
Othello board game  
Effective traversal algorithm for finding and making legal moves  
Beginner AI (Generates random locations until one is legal)  
Intermediate AI (Makes the move that flips the most enemy pieces)  

TO DO:  
Graphics  
Advanced AI (Would require studying Othello strategy to understand positional advantage)
