# Othello
AKA Reversi

Fun attempt to code a strategy board game in my down time.

Functionality:  
Othello board game  
Beginner AI (Generates random locations until one is legal)  
Intermediate AI (Makes the move that flips the most enemy pieces)  

TO DO:  
Better method of checking each direction  
Flexible function for traversal that can be used for legalMove, placePiece, and countFlips  
Advanced AI (Would require studying Othello strategy to understand positional advantage)  
More random intermediate AI (traverse the board starting at a random location instead of (1,1))
